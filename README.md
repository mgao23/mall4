Assignment 4



Write a Medium post on constructing and characterizing clusters in a given dataset. Using methods from module 4, you should construct a dataset of interest, select (and justify) a k value for the number clusters in your data, cluster your data using one of the methods we've discussed, and then describe what you think these clusters represent. As in the previous assignment, you may use any distance/similarity metric you like, but note that your choice of metric impacts which clustering metric you use.
